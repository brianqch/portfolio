                    Hi! Iâ€™m Brian, UC Berkeley alum with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    My time at UC Berkeley provided me with a solid foundation in computer science, while hands-on job experiences further deepened my knowledge and skills. Each project and role taught me valuable lessons and allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in practical, real-world scenarios. And in this time, I realized something.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    I just love building things.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Whether it be something as simple as a personal project or as complex as a full-scale application, I genuinely enjoy turning ideas into realities that have a lasting impact. I see every opportunity as a learning opportunity and I am always looking for new ways to grow.
